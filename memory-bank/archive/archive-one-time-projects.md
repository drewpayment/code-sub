# üóÉÔ∏è Level 3 Feature Archive: Add One-Time Project Plans

**Date:** 2024-08-01
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

---

## 1. Feature Summary

The primary objective was to expand the service offerings by introducing "One-Time Projects" alongside existing recurring subscription plans. This involved updating the data model, the admin plan management interface, and the public-facing pricing page. The effort was a success, and we even added a responsive collapsible sidebar to the admin UI as a bonus improvement.

## 2. Task Checklist & Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Backend & Data Structure

- [x] **Task 1: Evolve the `plans` Data Schema.**
  - **Description:** Modified the `plans` collection in PocketBase to support two distinct product types (`subscription`, `one_time_project`). This included adding `type`, `price_min`, `price_max`, and `features` fields, and making `billing_period` optional.
  - **Implementation:** Types were updated in `src/lib/types/subscription.ts` and the user updated the schema in their PocketBase instance.

- [x] **Task 2: Update Plan Management Actions.**
  - **Description:** Updated the server-side logic in `src/routes/admin/plans/+page.server.ts` to handle the new schema, including conditional logic in the `createPlan` action.

### Phase 2: Admin Dashboard UI

- [x] **Task 3: Refactor the "Add Plan" Form.**
  - **Description:** Enhanced the plan creation form in `src/routes/admin/plans/+page.svelte` to be dynamic, conditionally showing fields based on the selected plan type.

- [x] **Task 4: Improve the Plans List Display.**
  - **Description:** Updated the table on the admin page to clearly display both plan types, including a "Type" column and formatted price ranges for one-time projects.

### Phase 3: Public-Facing UI

- [x] **Task 5: Develop a `OneTimeProjectCard` Component.**
  - **Description:** Created a new, reusable Svelte component (`src/lib/components/OneTimeProjectCard.svelte`) to display one-time projects.

- [x] **Task 6: Update the Public Pricing Page.**
  - **Description:** Modified `src/routes/pricing/+page.svelte` and its `load` function to fetch and display both plan types in separate, clearly labeled sections.

### Bonus: Admin UI Improvements

- [x] **Task 9: Admin UI Responsiveness.**
  - **Description:** Improved the admin interface by making the sidebar collapsible and the plans table horizontally scrollable, ensuring usability on smaller screens.

## 3. Reflection & Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- **Phased Implementation**: Breaking the feature down into backend, admin UI, and public UI phases was highly effective.
- **Dynamic UI**: The admin form dynamically changing based on the selected plan type is a great UX improvement.
- **Responsive Design**: The collapsible sidebar and responsive table in the admin UI make the app much more usable on different devices.

### Challenges
- **Database Schema**: We initially forgot to update the PocketBase schema, which caused validation errors. This was resolved by the user updating their schema based on a provided `pb_schema.json`.
- **Linter Issues**: We encountered some persistent linter errors when creating the `OneTimeProjectCard` component.

### Lessons Learned
- **Schema First**: Always update the database schema before implementing the UI that depends on it. A checklist item for this was recommended for future planning.
- **Component-Driven Development**: Creating the `OneTimeProjectCard` component first made it easy to integrate into the pricing page.
- **Iterative UI Improvements**: It's beneficial to go back and fix UI issues like responsiveness after the initial implementation.
