# Task Archive: Authentication Security Improvements & Privacy Policy

## Metadata
- **Complexity**: Level 3
- **Type**: Intermediate Feature
- **Date Completed**: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}
- **Related Tasks**: PRD-AUTH-SEC-01

## Summary
This feature successfully enhanced the application's authentication system by introducing robust error handling, rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks, and a comprehensive privacy policy. The implementation improved both user experience and security, adhering to modern web standards and fulfilling all requirements outlined in the initial PRD.

## Requirements
- Implemented user-friendly login error handling, preserving form state.
- Implemented inline form validation without clearing user input.
- Added rate limiting (5 attempts/minute/IP) and account lockout (after 5 failed attempts).
- Created a new, responsive privacy policy page at `/privacy-policy`.
- Added a privacy policy acknowledgment link to the registration form.
- Reviewed and ensured the "forgot password" flow is user-friendly.

## Implementation Details
### Approach
The implementation was phased, focusing first on core error handling, then security, and finally on content and UI updates. SvelteKit's built-in form handling capabilities were central to the success of the error handling and form state preservation.

### Key Components & Files Modified
- `src/routes/login/+page.server.ts`: Modified to catch errors, return `fail()` objects, and implement rate limiting.
- `src/routes/login/+page.svelte`: Updated to display server errors and preserve form data.
- `src/routes/register/+page.svelte`: Updated to include the privacy policy disclaimer.
- `src/lib/components/Footer.svelte`: Updated with the correct link to the privacy policy.
- `src/routes/privacy-policy/+page.svelte`: New static page created with comprehensive policy content.

### Security Mechanisms
- **Error Handling**: Replaced `throw error()` with `fail()` to avoid leaking stack traces and to provide a controlled error response.
- **Rate Limiting**: Used in-memory maps to track login attempts by IP address and user account, effectively mitigating basic brute-force attacks.

## Testing
Manual testing was performed to verify all new functionality:
- **Login Errors**: Confirmed that invalid credentials display a user-friendly error without clearing the email field.
- **Rate Limiting**: Confirmed that excessive login attempts trigger the appropriate rate-limiting and account lockout messages.
- **Privacy Policy**: Confirmed the new page is accessible, and all links to it work correctly.

## Lessons Learned
- **SvelteKit Form Actions**: The `fail` function is a powerful tool for creating a seamless user experience during form submission errors.
- **Scalability of Security Features**: While in-memory rate limiting is effective for this context, future scaling would require a more robust solution like Redis.
- **Proactive Type Definitions**: Defining shared TypeScript types for common data structures (like form responses) can reduce boilerplate and improve code clarity.
