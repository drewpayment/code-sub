# Enhancement Archive: Revert E2E Test Suite to Stable State

## Summary
This task successfully restored the Playwright E2E test suite from a completely broken state (76+ failures) to a stable, working state with 120 passing tests. The process involved a systematic rollback of recent changes, including deleting a problematic new test suite (`auth.spec.ts`), temporarily disabling other new tests (content, visual, accessibility), and fixing a critical misconfiguration in `playwright.config.ts`.

## Date Completed
`2024-07-13`

## Key Files Modified
- `playwright.config.ts`: Corrected the `webServer` command from `npm run build && npm run preview` to `npm run dev`.
- `e2e/tests/content.spec.ts`: Renamed to `content.spec.ts.bak` to isolate from test runner.
- `e2e/tests/visual-regression.spec.ts`: Renamed to `visual-regression.spec.ts.bak` to isolate from test runner.
- `e2e/tests/accessibility.spec.ts`: Renamed to `accessibility.spec.ts.bak` to isolate from test runner.

## Key Files Deleted
- `e2e/tests/auth.spec.ts`
- `e2e/fixtures/test-data.ts`
- `e2e/fixtures/test-fixtures.ts`

## Implementation Details
The restoration followed a strict, multi-step plan:
1.  **Deletion:** All files related to the new, non-functional authentication tests were deleted to remove the primary source of errors.
2.  **Isolation:** Phase 3 tests were temporarily disabled by renaming their file extensions to `.bak`, preventing the test runner from discovering them. This reduced the scope to a known-good set of tests.
3.  **Configuration Fix:** The `playwright.config.ts` was corrected to use the `npm run dev` command, which was the critical fix that allowed the test server to run correctly with its backend dependencies.
4.  **Verification:** The test suite was executed, resulting in 120 passing tests, confirming the success of the rollback.

## Testing Performed
- A full E2E test run was executed using the `bun run test:e2e` command.
- **Result:** 120 tests passed, 0 failures.

## Lessons Learned
- **Trust the User's Instinct:** When a user reports a regression, the first priority should be to stabilize the system by reverting to a known-good state, rather than immediately debugging the broken state.
- **Global Config is a High-Priority Suspect:** Catastrophic, suite-wide failures often originate from global configuration files. These should be among the first places to check.
- **Systematic Isolation is Key:** The "divide and conquer" approach of disabling parts of the test suite is a powerful and efficient debugging technique.
