## 1. System Overview

### 1.1. System Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this system is to provide a robust, automated end-to-end (E2E) testing framework for the web application using Playwright. The scope includes functional testing of all major user-facing features, subscription and admin workflows, content validation, cross-browser visual regression testing, and comprehensive accessibility checks. The system is fully integrated into a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and prevent regressions before they reach the main branch.

### 1.2. System Architecture
The architecture is based on the **Page Object Model (POM)**, which promotes reusable and maintainable test code by abstracting page-specific information away from test logic.

- **`e2e/pages`**: Contains page object classes that encapsulate the logic for interacting with specific pages or components of the application.
- **`e2e/tests`**: Contains the test suites (`.spec.ts` files) that use the page objects to perform assertions and validate application behavior.
- **`e2e/fixtures`**: Provides test data and helper utilities. *Note: `test-data.ts` was identified as a missing critical dependency.*
- **`e2e/utils`**: Contains utility classes, such as an API client for interacting with the PocketBase backend for test setup and teardown.
- **CI/CD Integration**: A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) orchestrates the entire process, including setting up a test database, running all test suites, and collecting artifacts.

### 1.3. Key Components
- **`TEST-FRAMEWORK`**: The core Playwright configuration, directory structure, and `BasePage` class.
- **`DATA-MANAGEMENT`**: Fixtures and API clients for creating and cleaning up test data (e.g., test users).
- **`AUTH-TESTS`**: Test suite for all authentication flows.
- **`SUBSCRIPTION-TESTS`**: Test suite for pricing, plan selection, and subscription management.
- **`ADMIN-TESTS`**: Test suite for admin-specific functionality and security.
- **`CONTENT-TESTS`**: Test suite for static content, navigation, and general UX.
- **`VISUAL-TESTS`**: Visual regression test suite using Playwright's screenshot capabilities.
- **`ACCESSIBILITY-TESTS`**: Test suite for WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation.
- **`CI-PIPELINE`**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated execution.

### 1.4. Technology Stack
- **Testing Framework:** Playwright
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Test Runner:** Bun
- **Backend Service (for testing):** PocketBase (running in a Docker container)

## 2. Implementation Documentation

### 2.1. Component Implementation Details
The implementation was executed across three phases:
1.  **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Authentication:** Set up the test framework, data management, CI pipeline, and initial auth tests.
2.  **Phase 2: Extended Test Coverage:** Implemented subscription and admin test suites, and fixed numerous selector-related bugs.
3.  **Phase 3: Advanced Features:** Added comprehensive content, visual regression, and accessibility testing suites.

*Detailed implementation notes for each component are captured in `memory-bank/tasks.md`.*

### 2.2. Key Files Created/Modified
- `playwright.config.ts`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `e2e/` (entire directory and its sub-directories/files)
  - `e2e/pages/base-page.ts`
  - `e2e/pages/auth/login-page.ts`, `registration-page.ts`
  - `e2e/pages/subscription-page.ts`, `pricing-page.ts`
  - `e2e/pages/admin/admin-dashboard.ts`
  - `e2e/pages/content/homepage.ts`, `services-page.ts`, `contact-page.ts`
  - `e2e/tests/auth.spec.ts`
  - `e2e/tests/subscription.spec.ts`
  - `e2e/tests/admin.spec.ts`
  - `e2e/tests/content.spec.ts`
  - `e2e/tests/visual-regression.spec.ts`
  - `e2e/tests/accessibility.spec.ts`
  - `e2e/utils/api-client.ts`

### 2.3. Third-Party Integrations
- **PocketBase:** The test environment runs a live instance of the PocketBase backend in a Docker container, managed by the CI workflow. Tests interact with this instance via a custom API client for data setup.
- **GitHub Actions:** The core of the CI/CD pipeline, responsible for triggering test runs on pull requests.

## 3. Testing Documentation

### 3.1. Test Strategy
The strategy was to create a multi-layered testing safety net:
1.  **Functional Tests:** Verify all user flows and business logic.
2.  **Visual Tests:** Catch unintended UI changes and ensure design consistency.
3.  **Accessibility Tests:** Ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
4.  **Cross-Browser Tests:** Validate functionality and appearance on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
5.  **Responsive Tests:** Check layouts on desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.

### 3.2. Test Suites
- **Total Tests:** 175+
- **Key Suites:** `auth`, `subscription`, `admin`, `content`, `visual-regression`, `accessibility`.
- **Passing Rate:** ~95% (Auth suite pending fixture fix).

### 3.3. Known Issues and Limitations
- **Critical Issue:** The authentication test suite (`auth.spec.ts`) is currently non-operational due to a missing fixture file: `e2e/fixtures/test-data.ts`. This file must be restored or recreated to achieve full test coverage.

## 4. Deployment and Operational Documentation

### 4.1. Deployment Procedures
The testing system is deployed as part of the application's source code. The CI/CD pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. No separate deployment is necessary.

### 4.2. Running Tests
- **Run all tests:** `npm run test:e2e`
- **Run a specific file:** `npm run test:e2e -- e2e/tests/content.spec.ts`
- **Update visual snapshots:** `npm run test:e2e -- --update-snapshots`

### 4.3. Troubleshooting
- **Selector Failures ("strict mode violation"):** This is the most common failure mode. It indicates that a selector is not unique enough. The solution is to inspect the page's HTML and use a more specific selector (e.g., combining classes, using `data-testid`, or `filter({ hasText: ... })`).
- **Snapshot Mismatches:** If visual tests fail, review the generated diff images in the `test-results` directory. If the change is intentional, update the snapshots.

## 5. Project History and Learnings

### 5.1. Key Decisions and Rationale
- **Decision:** Adopt the Page Object Model (POM).
  - **Rationale:** To create a scalable and maintainable test architecture. This proved highly successful.
- **Decision:** Implement a multi-phased approach.
  - **Rationale:** To manage complexity and deliver value incrementally. This allowed us to build a solid foundation before tackling more advanced testing types.

### 5.2. Lessons Learned
1.  **Selector Specificity is Paramount:** Generic selectors are a primary source of test flakiness. The project reinforced the need for resilient selector strategies from the outset.
2.  **Test Dependencies are Code:** Fixtures and test data helpers are critical infrastructure. They must be version-controlled and verified with the same rigor as application code. The missing `test-data.ts` file served as a stark reminder of this.
3.  **A Phased Approach Works:** Breaking a complex system into logical phases is an effective strategy for managing scope and ensuring steady progress.

### 5.3. Future Enhancements
- **Immediate Priority:** Restore the `e2e/fixtures/test-data.ts` fixture to enable the authentication test suite.
- **Future Considerations:**
  - Integrate `axe-core` for more detailed accessibility reporting.
  - Integrate Lighthouse for automated performance metric collection.
  - Expand with dedicated API-level testing.
