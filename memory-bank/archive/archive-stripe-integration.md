## 2. System Summary
This project implemented a comprehensive, end-to-end payment and subscription management system using Stripe. The system handles the entire customer lifecycle, from initial subscription and payment setup to recurring billing, cancellations, and financial tracking. It includes robust admin-facing tools for monitoring financial metrics, managing individual customers, and viewing detailed billing histories. The system was designed to be resilient, gracefully handling legacy customers who were subscribed before the Stripe integration was in place.

## 3. Core Requirements
- **Automated Recurring Billing:** Implement Stripe Billing to handle automated monthly/yearly payments.
- **Customer Payment Setup:** Allow customers with pending subscriptions to securely enter payment details and activate their subscriptions.
- **Admin Dashboard Metrics:** Provide admins with a real-time dashboard showing key financial metrics (MRR, overdue accounts, failed payments).
- **Customer Billing History:** Allow both customers and admins to view a detailed history of payments, refunds, and invoices.
- **Graceful Cancellation:** Implement a cancellation flow that allows users to cancel at the end of their billing period, retaining access until expiration.
- **Legacy Customer Support:** Ensure the system does not fail for users without a Stripe ID and provides clear guidance for admins on how to migrate them.

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1. Architecture
The system is built on an event-driven architecture that leverages Stripe Webhooks as the single source of truth for subscription status changes.
- **Frontend:** SvelteKit was used to build the customer-facing account pages and the comprehensive admin dashboard.
- **Backend:** A dedicated Stripe service module (`src/lib/server/stripe.ts`) encapsulates all interactions with the Stripe API. A secure webhook endpoint (`/api/webhooks/stripe`) processes events from Stripe and updates the local PocketBase database.
- **Database:** PocketBase is used to store user and subscription data, including Stripe customer and subscription IDs, linking our local data to Stripe's records.
- **Data Flow:**
  1.  User actions on the frontend trigger form actions in SvelteKit.
  2.  Server-side logic calls the `stripe.ts` service module.
  3.  Stripe processes payments and sends webhooks back to our application.
  4.  The webhook handler updates the PocketBase database.
  5.  UI components query the local database for display, ensuring a fast user experience.

### 4.2. Key Components & Files
- **`src/lib/server/stripe.ts`**: The heart of the integration. Contains all server-side logic for creating Stripe customers, managing checkout sessions, fetching billing history, calculating financial metrics, and handling subscriptions.
- **`src/routes/api/webhooks/stripe/+server.ts`**: The secure webhook endpoint. It verifies signatures from Stripe and handles critical events like `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.payment_failed`, and `invoice.paid`.
- **`src/routes/account/subscription/`**: The customer-facing portal for managing their subscription, completing payment setup, viewing their own billing history, and initiating cancellations.
- **`src/routes/admin/`**: The entire admin section was enhanced.
  - **`dashboard/`**: Displays high-level financial metrics from Stripe.
  - **`customers/[id]/`**: Provides a detailed view of a customer, including links to their billing history and Stripe dashboard.
  - **`customers/[id]/billing/`**: A dedicated page showing a customer's full billing history and handling the "legacy customer" use case.
  - **`subscriptions/`**: The table of subscriptions was updated with links to each customer's billing page.

## 5. Testing & Verification
The system was tested through a combination of manual and automated methods:
- **Webhook Testing:** The Stripe CLI was used to send mock webhook events to the local development server, verifying that all event handlers worked correctly.
- **Payment Flow Testing:** End-to-end manual testing was performed using Stripe's official test card numbers for successful payments, failed payments, and disputes.
- **UI Verification:** All customer-facing and admin-facing pages were manually reviewed to ensure data was displayed correctly, especially for the legacy customer use case.
- **Build Verification:** The application was successfully built (`npm run build`) to ensure there were no breaking TypeScript or Svelte compilation errors.

## 6. Lessons Learned & Key Takeaways
- **Defensive UI Design is Critical:** The most important lesson was to anticipate data inconsistencies, especially when integrating a new system with legacy data. Building UIs that inform the user about these inconsistencies (e.g., the "No Stripe Integration" warning) is far better than letting the page fail or appear broken.
- **Admin Workflow Efficiency is a Force Multiplier:** Small, thoughtful additions, like adding contextual "Billing" links in multiple places, dramatically improved the usability of the admin dashboard and streamlined support workflows.
- **Abstract External APIs:** Centralizing all Stripe logic in a dedicated service module was a major architectural win. It simplified maintenance, debugging, and type management.
- **Proactive Legacy Data Planning:** A future process improvement is to formally analyze the state of existing data *before* starting implementation to identify potential edge cases like the non-Stripe subscriptions.
