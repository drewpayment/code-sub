## Summary
This document archives the successful implementation of a comprehensive Stripe payment integration system. The project covered the entire subscription lifecycle, including new subscriptions, payment failures, updates, and a user-friendly cancellation flow that provides clear access expiration dates. The system was built with a resilient architecture that combines immediate UI feedback with authoritative webhook processing from Stripe for data synchronization. The project successfully navigated complex third-party API nuances and TypeScript type safety challenges.

## Requirements
The core requirement was to automate the subscription payment lifecycle using Stripe Billing. Key functional requirements included:
- **Payment Capture:** Securely capture payment details and activate subscriptions upon successful payment.
- **Automated Recurring Billing:** Leverage Stripe to handle monthly/yearly recurring payments.
- **Failed Payment Handling:** Implement a workflow to handle failed payments, mark subscriptions as `overdue`, and provide users with a way to update their payment method.
- **Subscription Cancellations:** Allow users to cancel their subscriptions. A key requirement was that access should persist until the end of the paid billing period (no prorated refunds), and the user must be clearly informed of this date.
- **Billing History:** Provide customers with a view of their recent billing history (last 12 months) and a more comprehensive view for administrators.
- **Webhook Integration:** Reliably process Stripe webhook events to keep the local database synchronized with Stripe's state for events like `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, and `customer.subscription.deleted`.

## Implementation

### Architecture
- **Webhook-Driven Synchronization:** The primary mechanism for data consistency is Stripe webhooks. A dedicated endpoint (`/api/webhooks/stripe`) verifies and processes events to update the local PocketBase database.
- **Direct API for On-Demand Data:** To keep the local database lean, sensitive or extensive data like billing history is fetched directly from the Stripe API when needed, rather than being stored locally.
- **Service Layer Abstraction:** All server-side Stripe logic is encapsulated within `src/lib/server/stripe.ts`, providing a clean interface for the rest of the application to interact with Stripe.
- **Hybrid UI Updates:** The user interface uses a hybrid approach. For user-initiated actions (like cancellation), the local database is updated immediately for a responsive feel. This state is then confirmed and synchronized by the corresponding webhook event from Stripe.

### Key Components & Files Changed
-   **`src/lib/server/stripe.ts`**: (New File) Contains all server-side functions for interacting with the Stripe API, including creating customers, checkout sessions, and handling cancellations.
-   **`src/routes/api/webhooks/stripe/+server.ts`**: (New File) The webhook handler endpoint. Implemented secure signature verification and business logic for various Stripe events. The `handleSubscriptionUpdated` function was specifically enhanced to correctly process `cancel_at_period_end` events.
-   **`src/routes/account/subscription/+page.server.ts`**: The `cancelSubscription` action was a key area of work. It was modified to:
    1.  Call Stripe to cancel the subscription *at the period end*.
    2.  Immediately update the local database with a `cancelled` status and the correct `end_date`.
    3.  Safely handle TypeScript type conflicts when processing the response from Stripe.
-   **`src/routes/account/subscription/+page.svelte`**: The UI was updated to:
    1.  Display a clear, informative banner for cancelled subscriptions, showing the access expiration date.
    2.  Conditionally render action buttons based on the subscription status (e.g., hiding the "Cancel" button if already cancelled).
-   **`src/lib/types/subscription.ts`**: The `SubscriptionStatus` type was expanded to include `cancelled` and `overdue`. The `Subscription` interface was updated to include an optional `end_date`.
-   **`pb_migrations/pb_schema.json`**: The `subscriptions` collection was updated to include the `overdue` and `cancelled` statuses in its allowed values. (The `end_date` field already existed).
-   **`memory-bank/`**: Created `reflection-stripe-cancellation.md` and updated `tasks.md` and `progress.md` throughout the process.

## Testing
- **Manual End-to-End Testing:** The entire user flow was tested manually using Stripe's test card numbers.
    -   Successfully subscribed a new user.
    -   Successfully cancelled a subscription and verified the correct end date was displayed.
    -   Tested the failed payment flow using Stripe's specific test cards.
- **Webhook Testing:** Used the Stripe CLI to forward webhook events to the local development server, verifying that all handlers were triggered correctly and the database was updated as expected.
- **Bug Fix Verification:** After a user-reported bug (incorrect end date), the fix was explicitly tested by cancelling another test subscription, which confirmed the correct date was displayed and the initial error was resolved.

## Lessons Learned
- **Embrace Defensive Type Assertions:** The conflict between local and library types is a common issue. Using `as unknown as { ... }` is a powerful, safe pattern for accessing properties when the compiler is struggling to resolve type overlaps.
- **Prioritize Immediate UI Feedback:** For critical user actions, updating the local state immediately provides a much better user experience than waiting for an asynchronous process like a webhook. The webhook then becomes a reconciliation mechanism rather than the primary UI trigger.
- **Deeply Read API Documentation for Edge Cases:** The distinction between `ended_at` and `current_period_end` for a subscription cancelled at period end was a subtle but critical detail. This reinforces the need to read API docs carefully for the specific scenarios being implemented.
