# Level 3 Feature Reflection: Add One-Time Project Plans

## Feature Summary
The primary objective was to expand the service offerings by introducing "One-Time Projects" alongside existing recurring subscription plans. This involved updating the data model, the admin plan management interface, and the public-facing pricing page. The effort was a success, and we even added a responsive collapsible sidebar to the admin UI.

## What Went Well
- **Phased Implementation**: Breaking the feature down into backend, admin UI, and public UI phases was highly effective.
- **Dynamic UI**: The admin form dynamically changing based on the selected plan type is a great UX improvement.
- **Responsive Design**: The collapsible sidebar and responsive table in the admin UI make the app much more usable on different devices.

## Challenges
- **Database Schema**: We initially forgot to update the PocketBase schema, which caused validation errors.
- **Linter Issues**: We encountered some persistent linter errors when creating the `OneTimeProjectCard` component.
- **Sidebar Logic**: The initial implementation of the collapsible sidebar had some CSS issues that needed to be fixed.

## Lessons Learned
- **Schema First**: Always update the database schema before implementing the UI that depends on it.
- **Component-Driven Development**: Creating the `OneTimeProjectCard` component first made it easy to integrate into the pricing page.
- **Iterative UI Improvements**: Don't be afraid to go back and fix UI issues like responsiveness after the initial implementation.

## Process Improvements
- **Schema-First Workflow**: We should create a checklist item to update the database schema in the planning phase.
- **Linting Configuration**: We should review our linter configuration to avoid the issues we encountered.
- **UI/UX Review**: We should add a dedicated UI/UX review step to our process to catch responsiveness issues earlier.

## Technical Improvements
- **TypeScript Types**: We could create a more robust set of TypeScript types for our PocketBase collections to catch schema mismatches earlier.
- **Reusable Components**: The `OneTimeProjectCard` component is a great example of a reusable component that we can use in other parts of the app.
- **State Management**: The `sidebarOpen` and `isMobile` state management in the admin layout is a good pattern for other responsive components.
