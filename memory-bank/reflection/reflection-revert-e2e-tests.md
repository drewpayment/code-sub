# Level 2 Enhancement Reflection: Revert E2E Test Suite to Stable State

## Enhancement Summary
The primary objective was to restore the E2E test suite to its last known working state after it became unstable. This involved identifying and removing problematic new tests (`auth.spec.ts`), isolating other recently added tests (`content`, `visual`, `accessibility`), and fixing a critical configuration error in `playwright.config.ts`. The effort was a success, transforming a completely broken test suite into one where 120 tests pass reliably.

## What Went Well
- **Systematic Isolation:** The plan to methodically remove and isolate recent changes was highly effective. Renaming files with `.bak` was a simple, non-destructive way to quickly narrow down the problem space.
- **Rapid Turnaround:** We were able to diagnose and fix a catastrophic, multi-faceted failure and restore full stability in a single session.
- **Clear Tasking:** The `tasks.md` file provided a clear, step-by-step guide that kept the process focused and on track. Each task was verifiable and led directly to the next.

## Challenges Encountered
- **Initial Misdiagnosis:** The agent's initial attempts to fix the problem were incorrect. It got stuck trying to debug the `auth.spec.ts` and fixture files, which were symptoms, not the root cause. This wasted time and caused user frustration.
- **Hidden Root Cause:** The most significant issue—the incorrect `webServer` command in `playwright.config.ts`—was not immediately obvious and was masked by other errors.
- **Cascading Failures:** The sheer number of failures (76+) initially made it difficult to pinpoint a single source, as it looked like the entire system was broken.

## Key Learnings & Insights
- **Trust the User's Instinct:** The user correctly identified that the problem began after a certain phase of work. The agent should have prioritized reverting to a known good state *first*, as requested, before attempting to debug.
- **Global Config is a High-Priority Suspect:** When an entire test suite fails to run, a global configuration file (like `playwright.config.ts`) should be one of the first places to investigate.
- **Divide and Conquer is Powerful:** Isolating test files is a highly effective strategy for debugging test suites. It reduces noise and allows for focused problem-solving.

## Process Improvements
- **VAN Mode Adherence:** In the future, when a user reports a regression, the VAN (Verify, Assess, Navigate) process should more strictly prioritize creating a *plan* to revert or stabilize, rather than jumping immediately into implementation and debugging.
- **Staged Test Integration:** For future features, new E2E tests should be introduced in separate, clearly marked PRs. This makes it much easier to identify and revert changes if a regression occurs.
