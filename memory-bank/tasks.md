# Task Plan: Contact Forms Implementation

- **Complexity:** Level 3
- **PRD:** [prd-contact-forms.md](mdc:tasks/prd-contact-forms.md)
- **Priority:** High

---

## 1. Requirements Analysis

The goal is to implement functional contact forms across three key touchpoints:
- **Contact Page Form:** Main contact page with full form functionality.
- **Services Quote Form:** "Get a free quote" button integration on the services page.
- **Pricing Plan Form:** "Choose plan" button integration on the pricing page with plan context.

All forms will collect the same core information (name, email, phone, optional description) and store submissions in a centralized PocketBase collection for lead management.
