## Recent Enhancement: Subscription Cancellation âœ… COMPLETE

### **What Was Implemented:**
1. **Cancel at Period End:** Modified cancellation logic to use `cancelStripeSubscriptionAtPeriodEnd()` instead of immediate cancellation
2. **End Date Tracking:** Capture and store the subscription end date from Stripe's `current_period_end` 
3. **Cancelled Status:** Added "cancelled" to subscription status types and updated UI handling
4. **User Notification:** Added prominent banner showing cancellation status and access expiration date
5. **Action Button Updates:** Removed cancel button for already-cancelled subscriptions, showing access period instead

### **Files Modified:**
- `src/routes/account/subscription/+page.server.ts` - Updated cancelSubscription action
- `src/lib/types/subscription.ts` - Added "cancelled" status 
- `src/routes/account/subscription/+page.svelte` - Enhanced UI for cancellation display
- `pb_migrations/pb_schema.json` - Already had end_date field in subscriptions collection

### **Business Logic:**
- **No Prorating:** Users retain full access until the end of their paid period
- **Clear Communication:** Users see exactly when their access expires
- **Stripe Integration:** Leverages Stripe's built-in period-end cancellation feature
- **Database Sync:** Local subscription status updated to "cancelled" with end date stored

## 1. Architectural Overview

This feature will integrate Stripe Billing to automate the entire subscription payment lifecycle. The architecture will add new components for handling payments and webhooks while extending the existing `SubscriptionService` and database schema.

**Data Flow:**
1.  **Customer Action:** A customer with a `pending_payment_setup` subscription initiates the payment flow from their account page.
2.  **Stripe Checkout:** The application will generate a Stripe Checkout session. The customer securely enters their payment details directly into Stripe's embedded form.
3.  **Stripe Webhooks:** Stripe will send webhook events to a dedicated endpoint in our application to notify us of successful payments, failures, and other subscription status changes.
4.  **Database Updates:** The webhook handler will update the subscription status in our local PocketBase database (e.g., to `active` or `overdue`). It will also store the Stripe Customer ID and Subscription ID.
5.  **Admin & Customer Views:** The admin dashboard and customer account pages will query our local database for the subscription status and call the Stripe API directly to fetch and display billing history.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
-   **Leverage Stripe Billing:** We will use Stripe's robust subscription management system instead of building our own. This includes using Stripe for invoicing, dunning (payment retries), and automated email notifications.
-   **Webhook-Driven Synchronization:** The primary mechanism for keeping our system's subscription status up-to-date will be through Stripe webhooks. This creates a reliable, event-driven architecture.
-   **Direct API for History:** To keep our local database lean, payment history will be fetched on-demand from the Stripe API rather than storing every transaction locally.

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Data & Types)** âœ… COMPLETE
-   **File:** `pb_schema.json`
    -   **Change:** Modify the `subscriptions` collection to add a new `overdue` status option.
    -   **Change:** Add `stripe_customer_id` and `stripe_subscription_id` text fields to the `subscriptions` collection to store Stripe identifiers.
-   **File:** `src/lib/types/subscription.ts`
    -   **Change:** Update the `SubscriptionStatus` enum to include the new `overdue` status.
    -   **Change:** Add the new Stripe ID fields to the `Subscription` interface.

### **Phase 2: Backend Logic** âœ… COMPLETE
-   **File:** `src/lib/server/stripe.ts` (New File)
    -   **Responsibility:** Initialize the Stripe Node.js client with the secret key. This module will contain all server-side functions that interact with the Stripe API (e.g., creating Checkout sessions, listing invoices).
-   **File:** `.env` / `.env.example`
    -   **Change:** Add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
-   **File:** `src/routes/api/webhooks/stripe/+server.ts` (New File)
    -   **Responsibility:** The dedicated endpoint to receive and process webhook events from Stripe. It will verify webhook signatures and update our database accordingly.
-   **File:** `src/routes/account/subscription/+page.server.ts`
    -   **Change:** Add a new form action (`createCheckoutSession`) that generates a Stripe Checkout session and redirects the user to it.

### **Phase 3: Customer-Facing Implementation** âœ… COMPLETE

-   [x] **Task 3.4:** âœ… **NEW - COMPLETE:** Implement proper subscription cancellation with end date display and period-end cancellation.

**Status:** Customer-facing UI complete. Payment setup, billing history, overdue payment handling, and subscription cancellation implemented.

### **Phase 4: Admin-Facing Implementation** - MOSTLY COMPLETE
-   **File:** `/src/routes/admin/customers/[id]/billing/+page.server.ts` (New File)
    -   **Responsibility:** Fetches the complete billing history for a specific customer from the Stripe API.
-   **File:** `/src/routes/admin/customers/[id]/billing/+page.svelte` (New File)
    -   **Responsibility:** Renders the customer's billing history table, including links to Stripe invoices.
-   **File:** `/src/routes/admin/+page.server.ts`
    -   **Change:** Update the `load` function to fetch subscription metrics (e.g., counts of `overdue` and `canceled` accounts) from Stripe.
-   **File:** `/src/routes/admin/+page.svelte`
    -   **Change:** Add new dashboard widgets to display the Stripe-related metrics.
