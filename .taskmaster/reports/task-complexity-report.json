      "taskTitle": "Create User Login Page (`/login`)",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the login page implementation into subtasks such as: (1) SvelteKit route and page setup, (2) form UI with validation, (3) Pocketbase authentication logic, (4) session and auth store management, (5) error handling and messaging, (6) responsive and consistent styling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both frontend (UI, validation, responsiveness) and backend (authentication logic, session management) work, as well as integration with Pocketbase and global state. Each aspect is distinct and can be error-prone, especially handling async authentication and UI updates. Breaking it into at least six subtasks will help manage complexity and ensure thorough coverage."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Basic Error Handling for Authentication Operations",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for (1) registration error handling, (2) login error handling, (3) password reset error handling, and (4) user-friendly error display integration across forms.",
      "reasoning": "Error handling must be implemented across multiple flows (register, login, password reset) and requires both backend error catching and frontend display. Ensuring clarity and consistency in messaging adds to the complexity, but the logic is relatively straightforward if modularized."
