**Mitigation:** Test on multiple devices throughout development, use browser dev tools, implement progressive enhancement

### Business & User Experience Risks
**Risk:** Conversion rate lower than expected (target 2-5%)
**Mitigation:** A/B test different hero sections, CTAs, and pricing displays; implement user feedback collection

**Risk:** Chat system overwhelming or underutilized
