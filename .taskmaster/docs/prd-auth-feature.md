# Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a user authentication system for the CodeSub application. The primary goal is to allow users to create an account, log in, and manage their subscription information securely. This system will be built using Pocketbase for user management and authentication.

# Core Features
- **User Registration:** A secure registration page for new users to create an account using their name, email, and password.
- **User Login:** A login page for existing users to authenticate with their email and password. The system will manage the user's session.
- **Password Reset:** A flow for users to securely reset their forgotten passwords via email confirmation.
- **Dynamic Header:** The main site header will update its state to reflect whether a user is logged in or out, providing access to account information and a logout function.

# User Experience
- **User Personas:**
  - **New Visitor:** Someone interested in the service who needs to create an account.
  - **Returning User:** A registered user who needs to log in to manage their account.
- **Key User Flows:**
  - **Registration:** Visitor clicks "Sign In", then "Register", fills out the form, and is logged in and redirected to the homepage.
  - **Login:** User clicks "Sign In", enters credentials, and is logged in and redirected to the homepage.
  - **Password Reset:** User clicks "Forgot Password", enters their email, receives a reset link, and follows the steps to set a new password.
- **UI/UX Considerations:** All new pages (Login, Register, Password Reset) must be responsive and visually consistent with the existing homepage's design language, including fonts, colors, and button styles.

# Technical Architecture
- **System Components:**
  - **Frontend:** SvelteKit application.
  - **Authentication Backend:** Hosted Pocketbase instance at `https://pocketbase.hoytlabs.cloud/`.
  - **Global State:** A Svelte store will be used to manage the global authentication state (`pb.authStore`).
- **Data Models:** The standard Pocketbase `users` collection will be used, with fields for `name` and `email`.
- **APIs and Integrations:** The official `pocketbase` JavaScript SDK will be the sole integration point for all authentication operations.
  - `pb.collection('users').create(...)` for registration.
  - `pb.collection('users').authWithPassword(...)` for login.
  - `pb.collection('users').requestPasswordReset(...)` and `confirmPasswordReset(...)` for password recovery.
  - `pb.authStore.clear()` for logout.

# Development Roadmap
- **MVP Requirements:**
  1.  Integrate the Pocketbase JS SDK and set up a global auth store.
  2.  Create the `/register` page with its form and registration logic.
  3.  Create the `/login` page with its form, login logic, and a link to the password reset flow.
  4.  Implement the password reset request and confirmation pages.
  5.  Update the `Header.svelte` component to dynamically change based on `pb.authStore.isValid`.
  6.  Implement basic error handling for login and registration failures.
- **Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP):**
  - "Remember Me" functionality.
  - Social media logins (Google, GitHub, etc.).

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  **Foundation:** Set up the Pocketbase SDK wrapper/store. This is a prerequisite for all other tasks.
2.  **User Creation:** Implement the registration page. A user must be able to be created before they can log in.
3.  **Authentication:** Implement the login page.
4.  **UI State:** Update the header to reflect the logged-in status. This provides immediate visual feedback.
5.  **Recovery:** Implement the full password reset flow.
6.  **Protected Content:** Once login is functional, create the initial protected `/account` page.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Technical Challenge:** Dependency on the external Pocketbase service.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling (e.g., user-friendly messages) for scenarios where the Pocketbase API is unavailable or slow.
- **Scope Creep:** Adding features beyond the defined MVP.
  - **Mitigation:** Strictly adhere to the "Non-Goals" section and defer features like social login to a future development phase.
