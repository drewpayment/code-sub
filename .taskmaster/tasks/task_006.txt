# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Password Reset Request Page (`/forgot-password`)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the page and logic for users to request a password reset. This involves a form to enter their email and an API call to Pocketbase to initiate the reset process.
# Details:
Create a SvelteKit route for `/forgot-password`. Implement a form with an `email` input field. On submission, call `pb.collection('users').requestPasswordReset(email)`. Display a confirmation message to the user (e.g., 'If an account with this email exists, a password reset link has been sent.'). Ensure the page is responsive and visually consistent.

# Test Strategy:
Request password reset for an existing user's email; verify Pocketbase sends the email (requires Pocketbase email service configuration). Request reset for a non-existent email; verify a generic success message is shown. Test form validation and error handling (Task 4).
