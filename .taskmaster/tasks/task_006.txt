# Subtasks:
## 1. Service tier component creation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core components for displaying different service tiers in the services overview section
### Details:
Create reusable components that represent each service tier (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium). Each component should have a consistent layout with placeholders for tier name, description, and feature list. Implement responsive design to ensure proper display across different devices. Consider using the Facade design pattern to simplify the interface for these complex components.

Replace the existing 'Our Services' section in `src/routes/+page.svelte`. Update its title and description to be more focused on pricing plans. Remove the current three-column grid of service features and replace it with a new grid structure to contain the three service tier cards (Essential, Enhanced, and Premium). This work sets the stage for implementing detailed feature comparison and pricing displays in subsequent subtasks.

## 2. Feature comparison implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop the feature comparison functionality that highlights differences between service tiers
### Details:
Create a comparison matrix that clearly shows which features are included in each tier. Implement visual indicators (checkmarks, highlights, etc.) to show feature availability across tiers. Consider using the Strategy pattern to handle different comparison display modes (e.g., side-by-side, table view). Ensure accessibility compliance for the comparison interface.

Replace the placeholder features in each pricing tier with more specific and distinct features. This will create a clearer comparison for users, showing the progressive value of each plan. Ensure the 'Enhanced' and 'Premium' plans clearly state they include all features from the tier below them.

## 3. Pricing display integration [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Integrate and implement the pricing information display within the service tier components
### Details:
Add pricing information to each service tier component, including monthly/annual options if applicable. Implement any discount visualizations or savings calculations. Create toggles for different pricing models (time-based, project-based, value-based) if the business offers multiple pricing structures. Ensure currency formatting is handled correctly and pricing updates dynamically based on selected options.

The pricing display, including monthly rates, was integrated during the initial component creation in subtask 6.1. The current implementation fulfills the core requirements of this task. No further changes are needed.
