# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Basic Account Page (`/account`)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a basic `/account` page accessible only to logged-in users. For MVP, it can display basic user information and serve as a destination for the header link.
# Details:
Create a SvelteKit route for `/account`. Implement route protection using a `+layout.server.js` or `+page.server.js` load function that checks `pb.authStore.isValid` (or server-side equivalent by validating cookie). If not authenticated, redirect to `/login`. If authenticated, display basic user information from `pb.authStore.model` (e.g., name, email). Ensure responsiveness and visual consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Attempt to access `/account` when logged out; verify redirection to `/login`. Log in and navigate to `/account`; verify user information is displayed and page is accessible. Verify the 'Account' link in the header (from Task 5) navigates here.
