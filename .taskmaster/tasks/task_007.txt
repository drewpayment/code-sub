# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Password Reset Confirmation Page (`/reset-password`)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the page and logic for users to confirm their password reset using a token received via email. This involves a form for the new password and an API call to Pocketbase.
# Details:
Create a SvelteKit dynamic route like `/reset-password/[token]`. On page load, extract the `token` from the URL. Implement a form with `newPassword` and `newPasswordConfirm` fields. On submission, call `pb.collection('users').confirmPasswordReset(token, newPassword, newPasswordConfirm)`. On success, display a message and redirect to `/login`. Handle invalid/expired tokens gracefully (errors from Task 4). Ensure responsiveness and visual consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Complete the flow: request reset (Task 6), use the link/token from email, and successfully set a new password. Verify redirection to login and ability to log in with the new password. Test with invalid/expired tokens. Test form validation for password fields.
