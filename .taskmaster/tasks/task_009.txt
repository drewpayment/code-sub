# Task ID: 9
# Title: Ensure UI/UX Consistency Across New Auth Pages
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review and refine the UI of all new authentication pages (Login, Register, Password Reset, Account) to ensure they are responsive and visually consistent with the existing homepage's design language, including fonts, colors, and button styles.
# Details:
Audit `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password/[token]`, and `/account` pages. Apply global CSS or shared Svelte components to ensure consistency in fonts, color palette, button styles, form elements, layout, and spacing, matching the existing homepage. Test responsiveness across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

# Test Strategy:
Perform visual inspection of all new pages against the homepage design. Use browser developer tools to check responsiveness and consistency of applied styles. Verify common UI elements are identical or stylistically coherent across pages.
