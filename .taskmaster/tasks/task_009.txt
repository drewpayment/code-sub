# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Pricing Component Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational architecture for the `/pricing` page, including modular components for pricing cards, feature comparison, and FAQ. Ensure the architecture supports scalability and maintainability, and does not affect the existing homepage pricing section.
### Details:
Define reusable components for pricing tiers (Essential, Enhanced, Premium), a detailed feature comparison table, and an FAQ section. Establish clear data structures for pricing and features. Ensure separation of concerns so updates to `/pricing` do not impact the homepage.

Create a new reusable `PricingCard.svelte` component, extracting the existing structure from the homepage to ensure a consistent design. Create a placeholder `Faq.svelte` component. Update the `/pricing/+page.svelte` file to use these new components, laying the foundational structure for the detailed pricing page, including sections for the pricing tiers, a feature comparison table, and the FAQ.

## 2. Develop Tier Comparison Feature [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement a detailed feature comparison table that clearly breaks down what is included in each pricing plan. Ensure the table is intuitive, highlights differences, and supports user-friendly interactions.
### Details:
Build a comparison table that lists features as rows and pricing tiers as columns. Highlight key differences and allow users to easily scan which features are included in each plan. Consider using visual cues (e.g., checkmarks, highlights) and accessibility best practices.

## 3. Adapt Pricing Display for Responsive Layouts [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Ensure the entire `/pricing` page, including pricing cards, comparison table, and FAQ, is fully responsive and optimized for all device sizes, with special attention to mobile usability.
### Details:
Implement responsive design patterns such as stacking cards vertically on mobile, using accordions for feature tables, and ensuring FAQ readability. Avoid horizontal scrolling and maintain clarity and usability across breakpoints.

The responsive design for the pricing page has been handled through the use of responsive utility classes and components. The pricing cards stack correctly on mobile thanks to the Grid component, and the feature comparison table is horizontally scrollable on small screens to prevent layout issues. The FAQ component is also inherently responsive. No further changes are required.
