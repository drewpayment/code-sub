# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Basic Error Handling for Authentication Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add user-friendly error handling for common issues during registration (e.g., email already taken) and login (e.g., invalid credentials), as well as for password reset flows.
# Details:
In the `/register` page, catch errors from `pb.collection('users').create()` and display messages like 'Email already in use' or 'Registration failed'. In the `/login` page, catch errors from `pb.collection('users').authWithPassword()` and display 'Invalid email or password'. For password reset (Tasks 6 & 7), handle errors like 'Token invalid/expired' or 'User not found'. Display errors clearly near forms or as notifications, avoiding technical jargon. This task should be integrated during the development of tasks 2, 3, 6, and 7.

# Test Strategy:
Trigger known error conditions: register with an existing email, login with incorrect password, use an invalid password reset token. Verify that user-friendly, specific error messages are displayed and the application remains stable.
