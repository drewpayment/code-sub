# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Basic Error Handling for Authentication Operations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add user-friendly error handling for common issues during registration (e.g., email already taken) and login (e.g., invalid credentials), as well as for password reset flows.
# Details:
In the `/register` page, catch errors from `pb.collection('users').create()` and display messages like 'Email already in use' or 'Registration failed'. In the `/login` page, catch errors from `pb.collection('users').authWithPassword()` and display 'Invalid email or password'. For password reset (Tasks 6 & 7), handle errors like 'Token invalid/expired' or 'User not found'. Display errors clearly near forms or as notifications, avoiding technical jargon. This task should be integrated during the development of tasks 2, 3, 6, and 7.

# Test Strategy:
Trigger known error conditions: register with an existing email, login with incorrect password, use an invalid password reset token. Verify that user-friendly, specific error messages are displayed and the application remains stable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Registration Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement error handling for the user registration flow
### Details:
Create error handling for registration form that preserves user input, provides specific validation messages without blaming users, and offers clear remediation steps. Implement both frontend validation and backend error catching. Ensure error messages are highly visible and explain how to resolve issues (e.g., password requirements, email format validation).

## 2. Implement Login Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement error handling for the user login flow
### Details:
Develop error handling for login form that provides secure yet helpful error messages (avoiding overly specific messages that could aid attackers). Implement backend error catching with appropriate HTTP status codes. Create user-friendly messages for common scenarios like incorrect credentials, account lockouts, or maintenance issues. Ensure errors are visible and offer recovery paths when possible.

## 3. Implement Password Reset Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement error handling for the password reset flow
### Details:
Create comprehensive error handling for the password reset process including email submission, token validation, and password change forms. Implement backend validation with appropriate error objects. Design user-friendly error messages that guide users through remediation steps without revealing security-sensitive information. Ensure the system preserves user input when validation fails.

## 4. Create Consistent Error Display System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Develop a unified error display component for consistent messaging across all authentication forms
### Details:
Build a reusable error display component that maintains consistent styling, positioning, and messaging patterns across all authentication forms. Implement features to safeguard against likely mistakes, preserve user input, reduce error-correction effort, and concisely educate users on system requirements. Create error logging to external services for monitoring and improvement. Ensure all error messages avoid blaming users and instead focus on constructive guidance.
