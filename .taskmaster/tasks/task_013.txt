# Subtasks:
## 1. Image Optimization Implementation [deferred]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement techniques to optimize images, including using next-gen formats (WebP, AVIF), compressing images, and serving responsive images with srcset for different device sizes.
### Details:
Ensure all images are compressed before upload, use responsive image markup, and convert legacy formats to WebP or AVIF. Integrate image optimization into the build process or use a CDN with automatic image optimization features.

Image optimization for the hero section was implemented previously using the `<picture>` element with WebP formats and responsive `srcset` attributes. The `loading="eager"` attribute is also correctly applied for this above-the-fold image. As there are no other images on the site, no further action is needed for this subtask.

## 2. Lazy Loading Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop and implement a lazy loading strategy for images, videos, and other non-critical assets to defer their loading until they enter the viewport.
### Details:
Utilize native browser lazy loading attributes (e.g., loading='lazy') or JavaScript-based solutions for assets not supported natively. Ensure that above-the-fold content is prioritized and that lazy loading does not negatively impact SEO or user experience.

## 3. Bundle Size Analysis and Reduction [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Analyze JavaScript and CSS bundle sizes and implement strategies to reduce them, such as code splitting, tree shaking, and minification.
### Details:
Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify large dependencies, remove unused code, and split bundles for faster initial loads. Minify and compress assets before deployment.

## 4. Core Web Vitals Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Optimize for Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, INP, CLS) by addressing render-blocking resources, optimizing critical CSS, and minimizing layout shifts.
### Details:
Defer non-critical JavaScript, preload key fonts, prioritize above-the-fold content, and monitor third-party scripts to reduce their impact on responsiveness and stability.

## 5. Performance Testing and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Set up continuous performance testing and real-time monitoring using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse to track improvements and regressions.
### Details:
Automate performance audits in CI/CD pipelines, monitor key metrics over time, and set up alerts for performance regressions. Use gathered data to inform further optimization cycles.
