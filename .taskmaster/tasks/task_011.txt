# Task ID: 11
# Title: Refactor Auth Forms to Use Server-Side Actions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the existing client-side login and registration forms to use SvelteKit's server-side form actions. This involves moving the Pocketbase authentication logic to `+page.server.ts` files and using `enhance` for progressive enhancement on the client. This will fix a critical bug where the server-side session is not updated after login, causing incorrect redirects from protected routes.
