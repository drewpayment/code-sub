Starting Hero Component Structure & Styling

Analysis of Existing Code:
- A basic hero section structure already exists in src/routes/+page.svelte.
- It has a headline, subheadline, and CTAs.
- The layout is centered text on a white background.

Implementation Plan:
1.  Refactor HTML Structure: Modify the existing hero section to support a background image and an overlay for text readability, which aligns with the image strategy from Task 4.
2.  Add Background Image: Implement a placeholder for the hero background image. This will be a full-width, full-height image behind the text content.
3.  Create Overlay: Add a dark overlay on top of the image to ensure the white text has enough contrast and is legible.
4.  Update Styling: Adjust Tailwind CSS classes to handle the new layered structure (background, overlay, text content) using relative and absolute positioning with z-index control.
5.  Ensure Responsiveness: Maintain the mobile-first design, ensuring the new structure adapts correctly to all screen sizes.

Hero Component Structure & Styling Complete

Accomplishments:
Refactored HTML Structure: The hero section in src/routes/+page.svelte was successfully updated to support a layered design.

## 2. Content Integration and Trust Signal Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Integrate the finalized hero section copy (headline, subheadline, trust signal) from the content architecture into the hero component. Implement the trust signal display.
### Details:
Replace placeholder text with the actual headline, subheadline, and trust signal. Implement the display of the trust signal, ensuring it aligns with the design and is visually appealing.
<info added on 2025-06-07T17:18:36.047Z>
Replace the current placeholder headline and subheadline in src/routes/+page.svelte with the final, approved copy from the content architecture document.
Implement the "Trusted by growing businesses nationwide" trust signal below the CTAs. This involves adding the HTML element and styling it appropriately to be visible but not distracting.
Apply Tailwind CSS classes to the trust signal for appropriate font size, color (e.g., text-gray-300), and spacing.
Ensure the integrated content is rendered correctly and the trust signal is properly positioned and styled within the hero section.

Trust Signal Added: The "Trusted by growing businesses nationwide" trust signal has been successfully implemented below the CTA buttons.
Styling Applied: The trust signal is styled with appropriate color and spacing (text-gray-300, mt-6) to be noticeable yet subtle, reinforcing credibility without distracting from the primary CTAs.

Status: The hero section now reflects the finalized messaging and includes the key trust-building element as planned. The content is fully integrated.

## 3. CTA Implementation and Linking [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Implement the primary and secondary CTAs (Get Started Today, View Our Services) within the hero component. Link the CTAs to their respective target pages.
### Details:
Create button elements for the primary and secondary CTAs. Style them according to the design. Link the 'Get Started Today' CTA to the contact/lead generation page and the 'View Our Services' CTA to the services page.
<info added on 2025-06-07T17:23:03.522Z>
Verify `href` attributes for the 'Get Started Today' and 'View Services' CTAs point to `/contact` and `/services` respectively. Create basic placeholder Svelte pages for these paths to enable functional links and prevent 404 errors during testing. Manually test button navigation to confirm they lead to the placeholder pages.

<info added on 2025-06-07T17:24:48.382Z>
Accomplishments:
Link Verification: The href attributes for the primary (/contact) and secondary (/services) CTAs in the hero section were confirmed to be correct.
Placeholder Pages Created: Basic placeholder pages for /contact and /services have been created to ensure the links are functional and do not result in "404 Not Found" errors.
Functionality Confirmed: The hero section CTAs now successfully navigate to their respective placeholder pages, making the primary conversion paths functional for testing and further development.

Status: The CTA buttons in the hero section are now fully implemented and correctly linked.

## 4. Hero Background Image Implementation and Optimization [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement the hero background image, ensuring responsive optimization for different screen sizes. Consider using `svelte:picture` for responsive image handling.
### Details:
Add the hero background image to the hero component. Implement responsive image handling using `svelte:picture` or similar techniques to optimize image delivery for different devices and screen sizes. Ensure the image is visually appealing and contributes to the overall design.
<info added on 2025-06-07T17:26:19.190Z>
Building on Completed Work:
Hero section structure with an `<img>` tag placeholder is complete.
Image strategy defined with specific recommendations and responsive sizes.

Implementation Plan:
1. Download and Organize Images: Download the recommended hero image from Unsplash and create the three required responsive versions (desktop, tablet, mobile) as specified in the image strategy. Place them in the `static/images/hero/` directory.
2. Implement `<picture>` Element: Replace the current `<img>` tag in `src/routes/+page.svelte` with a `<picture>` element. This will allow for serving different image sources based on screen size, which is critical for performance.
3. Add Responsive Sources: Within the `<picture>` element, add `<source>` tags with `media` queries to specify which image version to load for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.
4. Set Fallback Image: Include a default `<img>` tag inside the `<picture>` element to serve as a fallback for older browsers.
5. Apply `loading="eager"`: Since the hero image is above the fold, ensure it loads immediately by setting `loading="eager"` on the `<img>` tag.
6. Verify Alt Text: Confirm that the descriptive, SEO-optimized alt text from our `alt-text.md` library is applied to the fallback `<img>` tag.
