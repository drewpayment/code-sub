# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create User Registration Page (`/register`)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the `/register` page with a form for users to input their name, email, and password. Implement the logic to create a new user account using the Pocketbase SDK.
# Details:
Create a SvelteKit route for `/register`. Implement a form with input fields for `name`, `email`, `password`, and `passwordConfirm`. On submission, call `pb.collection('users').create({ name, email, password, passwordConfirm: data.passwordConfirm })`. Upon successful registration, Pocketbase typically logs the user in automatically; ensure this behavior and redirect to the homepage. Implement client-side validation for required fields, email format, and password matching. Ensure the page is responsive and visually consistent with existing design language.

# Test Strategy:
Test successful user registration with valid data; verify user is created in Pocketbase, redirected to homepage, and auth store reflects logged-in state. Test registration with invalid data (e.g., duplicate email, mismatched passwords, missing fields) and verify appropriate error messages (from Task 4) are shown.
