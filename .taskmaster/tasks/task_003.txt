# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create User Login Page (`/login`)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the `/login` page with a form for users to input their email and password. Implement the logic to authenticate users using the Pocketbase SDK and manage their session.
# Details:
Create a SvelteKit route for `/login`. Implement a form with input fields for `email` and `password`. Include a link to the password reset page (`/forgot-password`). On submission, call `pb.collection('users').authWithPassword(email, password)`. Upon successful login, redirect to the homepage. The global auth store should update automatically. Implement client-side validation for required fields. Ensure the page is responsive and visually consistent.

# Test Strategy:
Test successful login with credentials of a user created in Task 2. Verify redirection to homepage and auth store updates. Test login with invalid credentials (wrong password, non-existent email) and verify appropriate error messages (from Task 4) are shown. Verify the 'Forgot Password?' link navigates correctly.
