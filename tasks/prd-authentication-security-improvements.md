# Product Requirements Document: Authentication Security Improvements & Privacy Policy

## Introduction/Overview

This feature addresses critical user experience and security issues in the current authentication system. Currently, login errors render API responses instead of user-friendly error handling, and form validation erases user input. Additionally, we need to implement proper security measures including rate limiting and add a privacy policy page to ensure compliance and user trust.

The goal is to create a secure, user-friendly authentication experience that follows security best practices while maintaining a smooth user interface.

## Goals

1. **Improve Login Error Handling**: Replace raw API error responses with user-friendly error messages that maintain form state
2. **Enhance Form Validation UX**: Show validation errors inline without clearing form data
3. **Implement Security Measures**: Add rate limiting and account protection against brute force attacks
4. **Create Privacy Policy**: Write and implement a comprehensive privacy policy page
5. **Update Registration Flow**: Add privacy policy acknowledgment to user registration

## User Stories

**As a user attempting to log in:**
- I want to see clear error messages when my login fails so I understand what went wrong
- I want to retry my login without having to re-enter my information
- I want my account to be protected from unauthorized access attempts

**As a user creating an account:**
- I want to see validation errors without losing my entered information
- I want to understand what data the company collects and how it's used
- I want to easily access the privacy policy during registration

**As a user who forgot their password:**
- I want a smooth, intuitive interface for resetting my password
- I want clear guidance on what to do after requesting a password reset

## Functional Requirements

### Login Error Handling
1. The system must display user-friendly error messages instead of raw API responses
2. Login errors must show the message: "The login credentials are invalid. Please try again."
3. The login form must remain visible and functional after an error occurs
4. Form fields must retain their values after a failed login attempt
5. Error messages must be displayed in an alert banner at the top of the form

### Rate Limiting & Security
6. The system must implement rate limiting of 5 login attempts per minute per IP address
7. After 5 failed login attempts for the same account, the system must force a password reset
8. Rate limiting errors must display: "Too many login attempts. Please try again in a few minutes."
9. Account lockout notifications must display: "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed attempts. Please reset your password."

### Form Validation Improvements
10. Form validation errors must be displayed inline with the respective form fields
11. Form values must be preserved when validation errors occur
12. Server-side validation must not replace the entire form interface
13. Validation errors must be clearly styled and positioned near the relevant input fields

### Password Reset Flow Review
14. The forgot password interface must be reviewed for user-friendliness
15. Users must receive clear instructions after submitting a password reset request
16. The password reset confirmation page must provide clear next steps

### Privacy Policy Implementation
17. A new privacy policy page must be created at `/privacy-policy`
18. The privacy policy must be accessible via footer links on all pages
19. The privacy policy must cover: data collection, usage, storage, sharing, user rights, and contact information
20. The privacy policy page must follow the site's design system and be mobile-responsive

### Registration Flow Updates
21. The registration form must include a disclaimer: "By signing up for an account, you agree to our [Privacy Policy](link to privacy policy)"
22. The privacy policy link in the disclaimer must open in a new tab
23. The disclaimer must be clearly visible and properly styled within the registration form

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Rebuilding the existing password reset functionality (already implemented)
- Implementing two-factor authentication (future enhancement)
- Adding social login options (future enhancement)
- CAPTCHA implementation (may be added later if needed)
- Email verification changes (already working properly)
- Auto-login after registration changes (already working properly)

## Design Considerations

- Error messages should use consistent styling with the existing design system
- Alert banners should be prominently displayed but not intrusive
- Form validation errors should use the existing FormError component pattern
- Privacy policy page should follow the same layout structure as other content pages
- Mobile responsiveness must be maintained across all changes

## Technical Considerations

- **Backend**: PocketBase with local username/password authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement server-side tracking of login attempts by IP and user account
- **Security**: Follow OWASP guidelines for authentication security
- **Form State**: Preserve form data using SvelteKit form enhancement patterns
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries to prevent API response leakage
- **Privacy Policy**: Static page that can be easily updated as policies evolve

## Success Metrics

1. **User Experience**: Reduction in user support tickets related to login issues
2. **Security**: Zero instances of API error responses visible to end users
3. **Form Completion**: Increased form completion rates due to preserved form data
4. **Compliance**: Privacy policy page accessible and properly linked
5. **Security**: Successful prevention of brute force attacks through rate limiting

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement session-based rate limiting in addition to IP-based limiting?
2. Do we need to log security events (failed logins, rate limiting triggers) for monitoring?
3. Should the privacy policy have a "last updated" date that's automatically maintained?
4. Do we need to implement any cookie consent mechanisms alongside the privacy policy?

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (High Priority)**:
- Fix login error handling and form state preservation
- Implement basic rate limiting
- Create privacy policy content and page

**Phase 2 (Medium Priority)**:
- Enhanced security logging
- Password reset flow UI improvements
- Registration disclaimer implementation

**Phase 3 (Lower Priority)**:
- Advanced rate limiting features
- Security monitoring dashboard
- Privacy policy version tracking
