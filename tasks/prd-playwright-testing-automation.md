# PRD: Playwright Testing Automation & CI/CD Integration

## Introduction/Overview

This feature implements comprehensive end-to-end testing using Playwright to ensure application stability and prevent regressions as the codebase grows. The implementation includes automated testing of critical user flows (authentication, subscription management, admin functions) and a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that validates changes before merging to the main branch.

**Problem:** As the application grows, manual testing becomes insufficient to catch regressions and ensure all user flows work correctly across different scenarios.

**Goal:** Establish automated testing infrastructure that provides confidence in deployments and prevents breaking changes from reaching production.

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Achieve 90% test coverage of critical user flows and edge cases
2. **Automated CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on every pull request
3. **Reliable Test Data Management:** Create and cleanup test data for each test run to ensure consistent, isolated testing
4. **Subscription Flow Testing:** Validate subscription management flows using Stripe test mode with mocked API calls
5. **Negative Test Coverage:** Include error handling and validation testing for robust application behavior
6. **Fast Feedback Loop:** Provide quick test results (fail-fast on first failure) to enable rapid development cycles

## User Stories

**As a developer, I want to:**
- Run automated tests locally before pushing code so that I can catch issues early
- Receive immediate feedback on pull requests so that I know if my changes break existing functionality
- Have confidence that subscription flows work correctly so that users can successfully manage their accounts
- Test error scenarios so that I know the application handles edge cases gracefully

**As a product owner, I want to:**
- Ensure critical user flows are always working so that users have a reliable experience
- Prevent regressions from reaching production so that we maintain application quality
- Have visibility into test results so that I can understand the health of our application

**As a QA engineer, I want to:**
- Automate repetitive testing tasks so that I can focus on exploratory testing
- Have comprehensive test coverage so that I can trust the automated testing suite
- Easily add new test scenarios so that I can expand coverage as features are added

17. **Customer Management:** The system must test viewing and managing customer accounts
18. **Billing History:** The system must test viewing customer billing history
19. **Plan Management:** The system must test creating, editing, and archiving subscription plans
20. **Subscription Oversight:** The system must test admin subscription management functions

### Content & Navigation Testing

22. **Contact Form:** The system must test contact form submission and validation
23. **Navigation:** The system must test primary navigation and footer links
24. **Privacy Policy:** The system must test privacy policy page accessibility and content

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
25. **Network Errors:** The system must test application behavior during simulated network failures
26. **Invalid URLs:** The system must test 404 error handling for non-existent pages
27. **Session Expiration:** The system must test user session timeout and re-authentication
28. **Browser Compatibility:** The system must test core functionality across different browsers

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
29. **GitHub Actions Integration:** The system must run tests automatically on every pull request
30. **Test Result Reporting:** The system must provide clear test results and failure details
31. **Fail-Fast Behavior:** The system must stop test execution on first failure for quick feedback
32. **Environment Setup:** The system must automatically set up test environment and dependencies

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Performance Testing:** Load testing and performance benchmarking are not included
2. **Visual Regression Testing:** Screenshot comparison and visual diff testing are not included
3. **Mobile Testing:** Mobile browser testing is not included in the initial implementation
4. **Cross-Platform Testing:** Testing on different operating systems is not included
5. **Integration with External Monitoring:** Integration with monitoring tools like Datadog or New Relic is not included
6. **Manual Test Case Management:** Test case management tools or manual test tracking is not included
7. **Production Environment Testing:** Tests will only run against development/test environments

## Design Considerations

### Test Structure
- **Page Object Model:** Implement Page Object Model pattern for maintainable test code
- **Test Fixtures:** Create reusable test fixtures for common setup/teardown operations
- **Test Data Factories:** Implement factories for generating consistent test data
- **Utility Functions:** Create helper functions for common test operations

### Test Organization
- **Feature-Based Structure:** Organize tests by feature area (auth, subscription, admin, etc.)
- **Shared Components:** Create reusable components for common UI interactions
- **Configuration Management:** Centralize test configuration and environment variables

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Playwright:** Latest stable version with TypeScript support
- **Test Database:** Use existing development database with test data isolation
- **Stripe Testing:** Integrate with Stripe test mode API for payment flow testing
- **Environment Variables:** Leverage existing environment configuration

### Integration Points
- **PocketBase Integration:** Test against existing PocketBase authentication system
- **Stripe Integration:** Mock Stripe API calls for subscription testing
- **SvelteKit Integration:** Test SvelteKit-specific features and routing

### Performance Considerations
- **Parallel Execution:** Configure tests to run in parallel where possible
- **Test Isolation:** Ensure tests don't interfere with each other
- **Resource Management:** Properly cleanup browser instances and test data

## Success Metrics

1. **Test Coverage:** Achieve 90% coverage of critical user flows
2. **Test Reliability:** Maintain 95% test pass rate on successful builds
3. **Execution Time:** Complete full test suite in under 10 minutes
4. **Regression Prevention:** Catch 100% of breaking changes before merge
5. **Developer Adoption:** 100% of pull requests include automated test validation
6. **Maintenance Overhead:** Keep test maintenance time under 20% of development time

## Open Questions

1. **Test Data Persistence:** Should we maintain a seed dataset for consistent testing, or generate all data dynamically?
2. **Browser Coverage:** Should we prioritize testing on all three browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) or focus on Chromium initially?
3. **Test Reporting:** Do you want test results integrated into pull request comments or just the standard GitHub Actions output?
4. **Subscription Plan Testing:** Should we test against specific existing subscription plans, or create test plans dynamically?
5. **Admin User Management:** How should we handle admin user credentials for testing admin functionality?
6. **Future Scalability:** Should the test framework be designed to easily accommodate API testing in addition to E2E testing?
