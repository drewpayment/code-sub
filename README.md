## 🚀 Deployment

The project uses SvelteKit's static adapter for optimal performance:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Environment Variables

This project uses PocketBase for the contact form submissions. You will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```
PB_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8090"
PB_EMAIL="your-pocketbase-admin-email@example.com"
PB_PASSWORD="your-pocketbase-admin-password"
```

Make sure your PocketBase instance is running and you have created a collection named `contact_submissions` with the required schema. You can run `bun run pb:migration` to automatically create the proper migration file, then start/restart PocketBase to apply it.
=======
The built application will be in the `build/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, etc.).
